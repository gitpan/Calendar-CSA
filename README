Useful information:

    This module provides Perl access to data using the X/Open Calendaring
    and Scheduling API, which is used by the Common Desktop Environment
    (CDE) Calendar Manager, and the Sun Calendar Manager. The CDE is
    available for most UNIX platforms, and provides a friendly and
    standardized graphical user interface. As the CDE is formed in part by
    licensed software, it is not freely available, and must be purchased,
    either implictly as part of your OS, or explictly, as in RedHat's
    TriTeal CDE for Linux.

    To build this module, execute these commands:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test

    And, if the test is successfull, install (possibly as root) via:
	
        make install

	If all went successfully, your perl installation now has a new
	'Calendar::CSA' module, with which you can access Calendar Manager data.
	
    As this module operates by communicating with the CSA server, that RPC
    server must be configured (and possibly running) for this module to
    operate (and for the test to have a chance of working.)
    
    Also, it is quite possible the test will fail for some miscellaneous
    reason (guessing the wrong username or machine name, or an unimplemented
    function) that would not prevent you using the module.

Documentation information:

    At this time, no documentation is available, unfortunately. The test.pl
    file contains, at the end, some code that demonstrates what can be done,
    but no formal documentation is provided. For the most part, the calling
    conventions and the data returned are very similar to the CSA C
    functions.

Technical information:

    To build this module, you must have the CSA libraries and headers, which
    possibly may not be included with your base CDE installation. The key
    libraries are csa, and possibly DtSvc. The only header required is
    csa/csa.h. Makefile.PL assumes these exist in -L/usr/dt/lib, and
    -I/usr/dt/include.  The names might differ (in which case Makefile.PL
    and Csa.xs will need to be modified), but the files must be present
    somewhere.
    
    The callback mechanism has been completely untested (I was unable to
    provoke any callbacks.)

Other information:

    This module was written by Kenneth Albanowski <kjahds@kjahds.com>, with
    considerable assistance by Bharat Mediratta
    <Bharat.Mediratta@Corp.Sun.COM>. It would not existed at all save for
    the generous donation by Red Hat software of a copy of the TriTeal CDE
    Developers Edition for Linux.
